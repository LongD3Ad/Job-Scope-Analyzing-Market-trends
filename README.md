# Job Scope: Analyzing Market Trends

## Project Overview
This project, "Job Scope: Analyzing Market Trends," is a comprehensive analysis of job market trends using data scraped from naukri.com. Our team of four members - Wesley Sam Thomas, Gagan Deep, Chetan, and Kanva - collaborated to collect, clean, and visualize job market data, providing insights into current employment trends.

## Project Components

### 1. Data Collection
- Utilized advanced Selenium techniques to scrape raw data from naukri.com
- Collected approximately 90,000 job listings

### 2. Data Cleaning and Processing
Several Python scripts were used to clean and process the raw data:
- `cleaned_company_info.xlsx`: Refined company information
- `cleaned_data_naukri.xlsx`: Main dataset with cleaned job listings
- `Cleaned_skills.ipynb`: Script for cleaning and standardizing skills data
- `company_size.ipynb`: Script for processing company size information
- `Salary_range_fix.ipynb`: Script for standardizing salary range data
- `SalaryFixed.ipynb`: Further refinements to salary data
- `unique_skills.xlsx`: Extracted and processed unique skills from job listings

### 3. Data Analysis and Visualization
- Created an interactive dashboard using Tableau (`Dashboard.twbx`)
- The dashboard provides a comprehensive Job Analysis Overview
